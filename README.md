Objectives:
1. To develop an IoT-based system capable of monitoring real-time soil moisture, temperature, and
humidity to optimize irrigation efficiency.
2. To integrate AI and machine learning algorithms for accurate rainfall prediction and smart crop
recommendations tailored to specific agro-climatic zones.
3. To automate irrigation control using sensor data and remote commands via mobile applications
(e.g., Blynk), enhancing agricultural productivity and water conservation.
4. To design a scalable system architecture that can be deployed across multiple farms or locations
with minimal hardware modifications.
5. To create a user-friendly interface for farmers to access climate advisories, monitor sensor data, and
control irrigation motors remotely.
